- move a tile to a cell, move another tile to another cell, 
  then move the first tile so that it makes a legal word with the first.
  The server errors with "All tiles must be in the same row or column".
  This should work, the position of the old cell is probably still in the
  array being submitted to the server.  Perhaps this array should be updated
  until that last second, when submitting to the server?
